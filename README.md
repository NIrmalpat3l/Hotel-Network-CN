# Hotel Network Configuration (4 Floors)

This network setup is designed to manage the operations of a hotel with specific VLAN configurations across four floors, providing isolated and secure communication for each department and service.

This hotel network uses VLANs to separate departments across four floors, ensuring secure communication. Four routers, using OSPF for routing, connect the floors, while DHCP services dynamically assign IP addresses to devices for efficient network management.

## Router Connectivity and OSPF Configuration

All four floors are connected through four routers, each assigned to a specific floor. The routers use **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** as the routing algorithm to ensure efficient and reliable communication between the floors.

Additionally, all routers are configured to provide **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** services to automatically assign IP addresses to devices connected to the network, ensuring smooth and dynamic address management across the hotel network.
